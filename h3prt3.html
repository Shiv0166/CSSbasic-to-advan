        <p>Iron Man, also known as Tony Stark, is one of Marvel’s most iconic superheroes. Created by Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Don Heck, and Jack Kirby, he first appeared in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963. Tony Stark is a billionaire genius, inventor, and philanthropist who creates the Iron Man suit after being injured and captured. His high-tech armor not only saves his life but also transforms 
            him into a powerful hero who fights threats ranging from terrorists to cosmic villains.</p>
            <h1>Fictional character biography</h1>
            <p>What makes Iron Man unique is his reliance on intellect and technology rather than superhuman powers. The suit gives him flight, advanced weapons, and unmatched defense systems, making him a symbol of human innovation and resilience. Beyond the gadgets, Tony’s journey explores themes of responsibility, sacrifice, and redemption as he evolves from a self-centered industrialist to a true hero who protects the world.

In popular culture, Iron Man gained massive global fame through Robert Downey Jr.’s portrayal in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, beginning with Iron Man (2008). His character arc, filled with humor, brilliance, and emotional depth, made him a fan favorite and a central figure in The Avengers. Tony Stark’s legacy lives on as an inspiration—showing that even with flaws and mistakes, one can rise to greatness through courage, intelligence, and heart.</p>
